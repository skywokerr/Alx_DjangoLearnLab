# View Implementation:
# Using Django REST Frameworkâ€™s viewsets, set up CRUD operations for both posts and comments in posts/views.py.

Step 5: Implement Pagination and Filtering
Enhance API Usability:
Add pagination to post and comment list endpoints to manage large datasets.
Implement filtering capabilities in post views to allow users to search posts by title or content.
"""
"""
Step 3: Implement the Feed Functionality
Feed Generation:
Create a view in the posts app that generates a feed based on the posts from users that the current user follows.
This view should return posts ordered by creation date, showing the most recent posts at the top.
